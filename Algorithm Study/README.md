<< Implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms in the CLR book with the Scala Language >>

This repository has been created to enhance my understanding on Scala and to refresh the knowledge on algorithms.

Various algorithms and data structures introduced in the famous book, "Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition, by Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest"(aka. CLR) have been implemented in Scala from scratch.
I tried to test the functional programming paradigm as well as the traditional imperative programming in Scala, which is a hybrid language supporting both paradigm.
If possible, I chose the FP paradigm first because it help to improve my skills in Scala more. As a result, many data structures are "persistent", which means that all intermediate snapshots can be recovered if necessary.
I preferred "val" to "var" and "recursion" to "loop".
